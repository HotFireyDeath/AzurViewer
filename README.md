# AzurViewer

[ A web explorer for Azur Lane. Look at detailed ship stats, descriptions and more. ]

*Currently in development, and therefore incomplete. If you want to try it out, click [this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/HotFireyDeath/AzurViewer/blob/master/index.html "this link") to preview the app in its current state.*

#### What is AzurViewer?
As stated above, AzurViewer is a web app that (currently) allows you to view detailed stats descriptions, and more of in-game ships. All ships available across all four versions of the game are searchable in the app.

#### The wiki does that, right?
Yes, and quite honestly, the data is fetched directly from the wiki. The point of AzurViewer is to provide a faster, easier way to search the ships you need to search. The wiki is more tedious to navigate, and you cannot easily compare ships.

#### Compare ships? What?
With AzurViewer, you will be able to compare ship stats. Want to see where Belfast is better than Laffey? Well, just type 'compare belfast, laffey' into AzurViewer.
