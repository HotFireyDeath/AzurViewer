# AzurViewer

[ A web explorer for Azur Lane. Look at detailed ship stats, descriptions and more. ]

*Currently in development, and therefore incomplete. If you want to try it out, click [this link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/HotFireyDeath/AzurViewer/blob/master/index.html "this link") to preview the app in its current state.*

#### What is AzurViewer?
AzurViewer is a companion app for any Azur Lane player. As of right now, the app is mainly focused on ships. With AzurViewer, you can search ships percisely (by rarity or elsewise), and view detailed stats about each ship. Easily compare ships, and find out which one is the best for you to use.

#### The wiki has that stuff, right?
The app directly pulls information from the [wiki](https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Azur_Lane_Wiki).  The companion app makes it easier than ever before to find in-game information, as well as clearly displaying stats in an simplistic, modern design.
